# OOPS Banner App - UC4

## UC4: Render OOPS as Banner using String Array and Loop

### Overview
This use case improves UC3 by eliminating multiple print statements.  
Instead of printing each line separately, all banner lines are stored in a *String array* and printed using a *loop*.

This improves:
•⁠  ⁠Code modularity
•⁠  ⁠Reusability
•⁠  ⁠Maintainability
•⁠  ⁠Readability

---

## Drawback of UC3
In UC3, each banner line required a separate ⁠ System.out.println() ⁠
